# Source playbooks

The why skill covers every available evidence category, using parent inline searches or substantial independent source investigators, each reading its source-specific playbook below. The playbooks are concrete examples for common MCPs. Adapt them for a different MCP in the same category. All vendor tool names below are examples, not guaranteed OMP tools: inspect the actual mounted MCP map and schemas before calling. Use only read-only operations. A child lacking MCP access hands the search to the parent; if the parent is also blocked, record an access gap rather than a null result.

| Category | Playbook | Example MCP it documents |
|---|---|---|
| Source control history | [`code-archaeology.md`](skill://why/references/sources/code-archaeology.md) | git, `gh` |
| Issue / ticket tracker | [`linear.md`](skill://why/references/sources/linear.md) | Linear (adapt for Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut) |
| Long-form documents | [`notion.md`](skill://why/references/sources/notion.md) | Notion (adapt for Confluence, Google Docs, Coda) |
| Real-time team chat | [`slack.md`](skill://why/references/sources/slack.md) | Slack (adapt for Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost) |
| Infrastructure observability | [`datadog.md`](skill://why/references/sources/datadog.md) | Datadog (adapt for New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk) |
| Error / exception tracking | [`sentry.md`](skill://why/references/sources/sentry.md) | Sentry (adapt for Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake) |
| Product analytics warehouse | [`databricks.md`](skill://why/references/sources/databricks.md) | Databricks SQL (adapt for Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt) |

Cross-cutting:

- [`incident-postmortem.md`](skill://why/references/sources/incident-postmortem.md). Add this if the target code looks defensive (null checks, retry, timeout, rate limit, feature flag, egress guard, OOM handler).
